<h3>About myself:</h3>
<br>

I am currently a RISD student majored in illustration, not quiet professional yet conscientious. Narrative and concepts are my fields of interest, while my experience of cultural encounters has engaged myself in concerning both Orientalism and Occidentalism. It is guaranteed that my future works will continuously be inspired by the namable artistic motifs of various civilizations. 
<br>
<br>
<h3>What is this website about?</h3>
<br>
I build this website to record the personal growth during my academic career. The artworks here, as you see, are scraps of ideas saved for my own inspiration. The updates will likely happen during breaks. Nothing significant about my works or this site yet! But if you would like to share this website, with all my gratitude please do so.
