<h4>About myself:</h4>
<br>

I am currently a RISD student majored in illustration, not quiet professional but conscientious. Narrative and concepts are my fields of interest, while my experience of cultural encounters has engaged myself in concerning both Orientalism and Occidentalism. It is guaranteed that my future works will continuously be inspired by the namable motifs of various civilizations.

<h4>What is this website about?</h4>
<br>
This website is where I store my in-class assignments and personal works, many of which are scraps of ideas saved for my own inspiration. Nothing significant about my works or this site yet! But if you would like to share this website, with all my gratitude please do so.
