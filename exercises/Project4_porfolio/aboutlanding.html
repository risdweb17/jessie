<h3>About myself:</h3>


I am currently a RISD student majored in illustration, not quiet professional yet conscientious. Narrative and concepts are my fields of interest, while my experience of cultural encounters has engaged myself in concerning both Orientalism and Occidentalism. More often than not I am drawn by the motifs and artistic representation of a specific historical phase, and what I fear the most is the ignorant appropriation of those motifs by myself. 


<h3>What is this website about?</h3>

I build this website to record the personal growth during my academic career. The artworks here, as you see, are scraps of ideas saved for my own inspiration. The updates will likely happen during breaks. Nothing significant about my works or this site yet! But if you would like to share this website, with all my gratitude please do so.

      2017 January 30th , it can now discplay on cell-phones and tablets. Checking the responsive effect is easier by using max-width than max-device-width, how the latter is not responses to the shrinking window size but able to be displaced on a phone screen is still a mystery for me.

      2017 February 2nd, forget to copy one line of codes to html files when building a hamburger menu for device with smaller width. The sticky menus complete disappeared, except for the one on homepage. Just one line of codes! Divs in my homepage are relatively positioned now, box-shadow drops according to how divs is laid on each other. Can’t figure out why z-index not working for floating object, another mystery.
